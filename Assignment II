bullets: 
---------
The above results explain us about the Mean Median and Standard Deviation of Horsepower, Accel and Weight.


1.Mean
The mean represents the average value for each attribute (horsepower, weight, acceleration) across all cars in the dataset.
Horsepower: An average of 105.08 suggests that most cars in the dataset have a moderate amount of horsepower. It means a few cars with much higher or lower horsepower. 
Weight: An average of 2979.41 pounds for weight shows that the typical car in this dataset weighs around 3,000 pounds. some cars might be much lighter or heavier.
Acceleration: The average acceleration value of 15.52 suggests that most cars in the dataset accelerate at a speed of around 15.5 units. This could help us understand how powerful the cars are in terms of performance.


2. Median
The median represents the middle value in the dataset when all values are ordered. 
Horsepower: The median of 95 tells us that 50% of the cars have less than 95 horsepower. This suggests that the dataset might have many cars with lower horsepower, and the mean of 105.08 being higher could indicate that a few cars with higher horsepower are pulling the average up.
Weight: The median weight of 2822.5 pounds is lower than the mean, means that many cars are relatively lighter, but there are a few heavier cars that increase the average.
Acceleration: The median acceleration of 15.5 is very close to the mean, So, half of the cars accelerate faster than 15.5, and the other half accelerate slower.


3. Standard Deviation (SD)
Standard deviation measures the spread or variation of the data. A low standard deviation means the data points are clustered closely around the mean, while a high standard deviation means the data points are more spread out.
Horsepower: The standard deviation of 38.77 tells us that there is significant variation in horsepower values among cars. While the average is around 105 horsepower, individual cars could have horsepower values that are much higher or lower than the mean.
Weight: The standard deviation of 847 pounds in weight shows that there is a wide range of car weights. Some cars might be very lightweight, while others are much heavier.
Acceleration: The standard deviation of 2.80 suggests that acceleration times are relatively consistent among the cars, with less variation compared to horsepower or weight. This indicates that most cars in the dataset have acceleration values close to the average of 15.5.
